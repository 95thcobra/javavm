# JavaVM

Yeah so this is nowhere near finished but hey let's put it on the internet for people to look at.
Be careful though. It's pretty bad in there and I don't want to be responsible for anyone going crazy.

Supported things include:
* Threading
* Filesystem (some of it)
* Networking (some of it)
  * No SSL though
* invokedynamic (kind of)
* Defining new classes
* It's been like a year since I worked on this so probably other stuff

## For Zelix People

If you work at Zelix and you're reading this, just pretend like this doesn't even exist. Definitely don't design new features intended to circumvent this!

I'm super busy these days so I don't have much time to play with you guys, but at least give me some time to catch up ok? Also feel free to hmu if you ever wanna chat :)
